# PRODUCT_PLAN.md

## Product: CountOnMe — Calorie Tracking App

### Vision
A fast, offline-first calorie tracker that starts manual and later adds AI dish parsing. The app must be simple enough to use daily without friction.

### Problem
Existing calorie apps are either:
- too heavy (accounts, ads, paywalls, endless features), or
- too rigid (hard to edit ingredients / grams fast),
or both.

### Target users
- People tracking calories for weight management or fitness.
- Users who want control over ingredients and grams.
- Users who don’t want accounts or cloud sync for basics.

### Value proposition
- Manual tracking is quick and transparent.
- Meals built from your own products, editable anytime.
- Later: paste a dish name → AI proposes ingredients + calories, and you adjust.

## Goals & Targets

### Product goals (what we want to achieve)
1. **Ship a usable MVP** for manual nutrition tracking.
2. **Minimize logging time** so daily habit sticks.
3. **Build a clean base** for AI parsing later without rewriting core logic.

### Measurable targets (definition of success)
**MVP targets**
- Add a product in < 15 seconds.
- Log a meal in < 60 seconds.
- Data persists after restart 100% of the time.
- Zero critical crashes during normal flows.

**After MVP**
- AI dish parsing reduces meal logging to < 20 seconds average.
- Ingredient edits update totals instantly (< 100ms).

## Scope

### MVP scope (must-have)
**Products**
- Add product manually (name, kcal/100g).
- Edit product.
- Delete product.
- Search products list.

**Meals**
- Create meal by selecting products + grams.
- Auto-calc total calories.
- Save meals.
- View meal history.
- Edit meals.

**Tech**
- Offline persistence (local only).
- No signup, no cloud.

### Out of scope for MVP
- AI/LLM parsing.
- Barcode scanner.
- Diet plans, reminders.
- Accounts / sync / sharing.
- Nutrition database import.

## Milestones (Waterfall)

### Milestone A — Project skeleton
- Expo RN app created.
- Basic folder structure.
- Navigation shell.

**Done when**
- App runs on Android device/emulator without errors.
- Tabs navigate correctly.

### Milestone B — Manual products
- Products list.
- Product form with validation.
- Local persistence.
  
**Done when**
- Add product → restart app → product still there.

### Milestone C — Product edit/delete
- Edit screen prefilled.
- Delete with confirm.

**Done when**
- Edits persist and reflect in meal calculations.

### Milestone D — Meal builder
- Select products into meal.
- Input grams per item.
- Live total calories.
- Save meal.

**Done when**
- Meal appears in history after save.

### Milestone E — Meal details + edit
- Meal details screen.
- Meal edit mode in builder.

**Done when**
- Editing meal updates history total, no duplicates.

### Milestone F — Polish + stabilization
- Search products.
- Improve empty/loading states.
- Edge-case QA.

**Done when**
- No obvious UX holes / crashes.
- MVP ready for daily use.

### Milestone G — AI dish parsing (post-MVP)
- Text input “Describe dish”.
- Backend LLM call.
- UI to accept/adjust ingredients.

**Done when**
- AI output editable into a normal meal flow.

## Key risks & mitigations
- **Scope creep** → freeze MVP scope until Milestone F done.
- **Bad meal UX** → daily usage by you is the test; fix friction first.
- **AI accuracy issues** → AI is optional UI layer, manual edit always wins.

---

## Release plan
- Internal Android build first.
- Use for 2–4 weeks personally.
- Gather friction notes → patch.
- Only then start AI milestone.

---

## Post-MVP roadmap (high level)
1. AI dish parsing + edit flow.
2. Favorites / meal templates.
3. SQLite migration if dataset grows.
4. Optional cloud sync.
