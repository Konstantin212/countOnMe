feat: add backend API and client sync infrastructure

Backend:
- FastAPI scaffold with Docker Compose (Postgres + API)
- Alembic migrations for devices, products, portions, food_entries, body_weights
- Anonymous device auth with SHA-256 token hashing
- CRUD endpoints for products, portions, food entries, stats, weights
- Sync endpoint for future two-way sync
- Add .gitignore to exclude __pycache__

Client:
- Device identity and token storage
- API HTTP wrapper with auto-registration
- API modules for products, portions, food entries, stats
- Offline-first sync queue with exponential backoff
- Sync status UI in Profile screen
- Update dependencies to latest versions
